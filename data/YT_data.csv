Curtis is the third studio album by American rapper 50 Cent; it was released on September 11, 2007, by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album features production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Timbaland, among others. Music writers have noted that 50 Cent divides between ""hard"" and ""soft"" songs on the album.

Curtis received generally mixed reviews from music critics upon release. The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 691,000 copies in its first week. After years of slumping sales, the album's competition with Kanye West's Graduation (2007) and the resulting record breaking performances both albums displayed was considered to be a ""great day for hip hop.""

Cell phones, TVs, computer, cars, game consoles, and more were always introducing sleek new features that were changing the world. However, the past decade or so has seen a shift in how we perceive that nostalgic technology. With advancements in AI and addictive design, people are not so hyped about technological advancements anymore.

This video goes over how revolutionary technology was in the 90s and 2000s, the homogenization of technology, and why we stopped loving tech so much in the 2010s.

Lyrics
[Intro: 50 Cent]
Somethin' special
Unforgettable
50 Cent (Cent)
Justin ('tin)
Timbaland ('land)
Godd***, d***

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
I'm ballin', throwing money 'round

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as h***, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money-money, she make it, make it
Look at the way she shake it, shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head f***ed up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til you ready to pop

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, 'til daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you, girl

[Verse 2: 50 Cent; 50 Cent w/ Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this b**** 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, d***, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized

Williams X Jet

The Williams X-Jet, developed by Williams International, was a small, single-person, lightweight vertical take-off and landing aircraft powered by a modified Williams F107 turbofan engine — designated WR-19-7 — with some minor modifications. Because of its design, the craft was dubbed ""The Flying Pulpit"". It was designed to transport one operator and be controlled by leaning in the desired direction while regulating engine output power. It could move in any direction, accelerate quickly, hover and rotate on its axis, as well as remain aloft for up to 45 minutes, and travel at speeds of up to 60 mph. The United States Army evaluated it in the 1980s, but it was deemed inferior to the capabilities of helicopters and small, uncrewed aircraft, so the X-Jet program was halted.

The Radiant Energy Device

Dr. T. Henry Moray of Salt Lake City invented the first gadget to extract energy from the meta frequency oscillations of empty space in the early 1900s. Moray was eventually able to create a free energy gadget that weighed sixty pounds and generated 50,000 watts of electricity for several hours. Ironically, despite frequently demonstrating his gadget to scientists and engineers, Moray was unable to secure money to further develop the device into a usable power station capable of supplying electrical power on a large scale. Before World War II, Moray worked briefly with the Rural Electrification Agency on the machine's development. At the time, the R.E.A. was reportedly penetrated by Communist supporters and high-ranking officers with a distinctly pinkish tint. These officials repeatedly pressed Moray to pass over all details of his gadget to the Soviet Union, including arranging for high-level Soviet scientists to visit the Moray laboratory to view the device in action. On the initiative of the Communist-infiltrated R.E.A., one person—let us call him ""Z""—spent about two months in Moray's laboratory and managed to gain Moray's full confidence. Moray eventually revealed most of the secrets of the manufacture of his special valve to ""Z""—the only person in whom Moray had ever entirely confided. There is considerable evidence that ""Z"" was a Soviet operative, and that this was where the Soviets originally got the idea to construct the hyperspace amplifiers that would later be utilized in their psychotronic weapons.",1587482,16075,1231,0.0109,0:22:16,27,"Forbidden Technologies and The Silencing of Their Inventors, discovery, inventions, unexplained, mysterious, universe, techology, facts, interesting, scientists discovery, inventors, silenced, innovations, myterious, creators, inventors and inventions, inventions guy, imgur inventions, simple inventions, mystery, science, terrifying discovery, inventions and inventors, history, historical, historical facts, weird history, secrets, tesla, energy, dark energy, gadgets, tools, Forbidden, Forbidden inventions",384000,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZobTxGcMQfWEJ3Di_bYycw

About This Video:
I made a water powered forge blower to blow air into a furnace. Getting running water to power a blower had been on my list for a while now and the weather had been wet enough to cause enough flow in the creek to try one. A significant part of the labour in doing an iron smelt comes from the operation of the air supply (unless natural draft is used). The current air supply method I use was a hand powered, centrifugal fan encased in a housing as seen in previous videos.

 I had a 2 ideas as to how to automate this with water power. The first method was to build a large, slow water wheel and run a rope belt around it linking it to the smaller, faster fan rotor to spin it. I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. 

The second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.

With some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future.

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.

These tiny microprocessors power nearly every aspect of modern life, from computers and smartphones to cars, refrigerators, and even advanced military technologies. 

Chip War
Year: 2023  
Duration: 52 minutes  
Production: Babel Doc  
Director: Nicolas Vescovacci  
Language: English  
Country of Production: France  

The global shortage of these essential components has exposed the fragility of supply chains, driving inflation, stalling industries, and intensifying geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China.  

In 2021 alone, an estimated 10 million cars were not produced due to a lack of semiconductors. Yet while demand for these cutting-edge chips has soared, their production remains concentrated in only a handful of locations, with 63% of all chips produced in Taiwan. This dependency has made Taiwan not only the nerve center of the global tech economy but also a flashpoint in the ongoing power struggle between superpowers.  

Chip War explores how this reliance on a single island has placed the world’s economic and technological stability at risk. With Taiwan at the heart of a potential geopolitical conflict, the stakes could not be higher. This documentary examines the history, science, and strategic importance of semiconductors, detailing the efforts of governments and industries to diversify production and reduce dependency on a fragile supply chain.  

Through expert interviews and in-depth analysis, the film reveals how the semiconductor shortage is reshaping global relations and affecting daily life. From stalled car production lines to rising prices of consumer goods, the battle for microprocessors has already begun. But what solutions exist to secure this critical resource, and at what cost? Chip War provides a gripping look at one of the most urgent and complex challenges of our time.

About This Video:
I tested a fly wheel on the blower. Taking an old clay fly wheel from the pump drill I made many years ago, I attached it to the axle of the one way spinning blower to see how it would effect performance. The fly wheel tends to smooth out the speed of the fan and maintaining high speed despite taking longer to get up to speed initially. A smelt was conducted using the new set up and the result was less iron than usual due to the rotor coming out of the bearings at times. To fix this, the thrust bearings were replaced with journal bearings by carving holes all the way through the wooden stakes as opposed to only part way through. The new set up is more stable and has no chance of coming out during use.
Then, before the new set up could be tested, the monsoon season began and it rained nonstop for a week such that the hut had rain blowing in from its open sides making it impossible to make fire. A third wall was added to the hut made from fired bricks and clay mortar. A damaged section of roof was repaired with tiles salvaged from the old hut. Then I build a small water wheel that rolled up stream on wooden tracks to make use of the water. Looking forward I will probably do some water powered projects until the wet season eases.

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.

Lyrics:

So hot
Out the box
Can you pick up the pace?
Turn it up,
Heat it up
I need to be entertained
Push the limit
Are you with it?
Baby, don't be afraid
I'm a hurt 'ya real good, baby

Let's go
It's my show
Baby, do what I say
Don't trip off the glitz
That I'm gonna display
I told ya
I'm a hold ya down until you're amazed
Give it to ya 'til you're screaming my name

No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way you'll ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over",57427493,372949,40911,0.0072,0:03:37,10,"whadaya, want from me, acoustic, music, american idol, never close, queen, original high, if had you, official, download, For Your Entertainment live, remix, For Your Entertainment lyrics, Adam Lambert live, AdamLambertVevo, lyrics, Adam Lambert, official video, cover, ghost town, Adam Lambert For Your Entertainment Official, mad world, original, Sony, Vevo, Adam Lambert lyrics, Adam Lambert For Your Entertainment, music video, single",639000,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSpA4zQzlhoPCY2-usyGAMA

Adam Scott (Mark,) Patricia Arquette (Harmony Cobel,) Britt Lower (Helly,) John Turturro (Irving,) and Zach Cherry (Dylan) tackle everything from cloning conspiracies to the true purpose of the goats, and even what the theme song might be trying to tell us.

Do the numbers MDR processes mean anything? Is Dylan hiding a shocking outie secret? Why does Irving paint elevators, and is Gemma alive or what?

'Severance' Season 2 premieres on AppleTV+ January 17, 2025.

Song Lyrics:

Koi Jaage Soye Mujh Mein
Meri Raatein Aur Mere Din
Saare Khoye Usmein
Koi Itna Apna Laage
Mera Nadaan Yeh Dil
Jaise Dhadke Usmein
Mujhe Jo Hua Hai, Iski Na Dawa Hai
Kisi Ne Chhua Hai Dil
Yeh Kiski Nazar Ka Hai Asar
Poochhe Jo Koi Toh Tera Naam Doon
Poochhe Jo Koi Toh Tera Naam Doon
Main Keh Doon Sabhi Se 
Yeh Tera Hi To Hai Asar

Koi Dastak De Ke Dil Pe
Milne Ko Aata Hai
Mujh Mein Reh Jaata Hai
Koi Qismat Jaisa Laage
Khushiyan Inn Haathon Pe 
Likhta Hi Jaata Hai
Yeh Kaisi Khata Hai, Jiski Na Saza Hai
Kisi Ne Chhua Hai Dil,
Yeh Kiski Dua Ka Hai Asar
Poochhe Jo Koi To Tera Naam Doon

Zariwale Kagazon Mein Lipta Hua
Kitne Haseen Rangon Se Ranga Hua
Kya Tohfa Khuda Ne
Mujhe Hai De Diya...
Labon Se Raaz Yeh Phisal Na Jaaye Yun
Pighalne Laga Hai, Kiske Liye Mera Sabar
Pooche Jo Koi To Tera Naam Doon

Let’s ride with The Road Rangers in their fleet of superhero trucks and animated vehicles as they get into tricky situations on their many adventures. But together, they find a way out of it and teach your little toddlers and tiny tots important lessons in the process.
Zooming and flying around the imaginary city in these magical monster trucks will teach your preschoolers social responsibility, team dynamics and to think outside of the box when they’re in a tough spot. The bright and racy videos offer popular rhymes, stories, and children’s songs which will help engage your kids better at learning the basic concepts, whether it is alphabets, animals, shapes, colors, weekdays or fruits, and form the building blocks for later years of schooling.
So make the screen time of your kids count as the team of Road Rangers protects the citizens of their town from danger while squeezing in a little learning for your precious babies.

Veera Vanilla

Oh Bhai Teri Jawaani The End Ho Gayi
Teri Saari Deewani Saddi Friend Ho Gayi

Oye Kudiye Season Shadi Ka Hai
Pandit Bhi Hai Ready
Kanyadan Karega Veera
Mat Bulwana Daddy
Ainwayi Busy Rehte Hain Baarati Apne
Ek Budget Mein Fit Ho Jaaye
Do Ghar Ke Sapne
Koi Band Toh Bajwaado...
Koi Band Toh Bajwaado 
Sadde Veerey Di Wedding Hai

Bottalein Khulwa Do

Dry ice is basically solid carbon dioxide. The surface temperature of a dry ice block is about -78 degrees Celsius or -109 degrees Fahrenheit. This means it is much cooler than ordinary ice which is made up of water.

If dry ice comes in contact with our skin, our cells begin to freeze and die within seconds, thus giving us severe frostbite. In addition to this, storing dry ice in airtight containers can be dangerous.

Do you know why?

This is because dry ice sublimates, i.e., it directly gets converted from solid state to gaseous state. Hence, in airtight containers, the gas produced can build up and exert pressure on the walls of container which can lead to a dangerous explosion.

He encouraged teachers to focus on developing skills in students that make them ""AI-proof"" - critical thinking, creativity, curiosity, and lifelong learning. These distinctively human skills should allow students to stay relevant in an AI world. Yılmaz also stressed on the importance of learning to leverage AI while realizing the importance of human creativity to drive innovation. Yılmaz Köylü is a lecturer in the Center for Language Education at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He has a Ph.D. in Linguistics and Second Language Studies from Indiana University, Bloomington in the United States. He has 16 years of teaching experience in various universities in Turkey, the US, and in Hong Kong. As a language educator and researcher, Yılmaz Köylü’s overarching principle in teaching is empowering students to be lifelong learners. With the overarching principle in mind, a key parameter in Yılmaz Köylü’s teaching is adapting and evolving based on new teaching and learning contexts. Latest developments in artificial intelligence have unearthed its wide ranging and fascinating capabilities, which will transform teaching and learning. Thus, as a language educator and researcher, he is committed to making the best use of AI to empower the next generations.

Hello friends! Welcome to a new Happy Learning video.
Have you ever wondered how plants feed? To answer this question, we need to understand photosynthesis! 

Photosynthesis is a process in which plants make their own food to be able to grow and develop. In order to perform photosynthesis, they need various elements: sunlight, carbon dioxide, obtained from air and water. They also need chlorophyll, which is a green substance that all plants have, and is fundamental for performing photosynthesis, since it could not happen without it. By the way! chlorophyll is what gives all plants their green colour! 

But how does photosynthesis take place? 
Look at this plant. As you can see, its roots are anchored to the ground, and through them, the plant absorbs water and minerals in the soil.
Water with minerals are transported up the stem, reaching the leaves. The leaves are full of tiny pores, called stomata, which absorb carbon dioxide that air in their surrounding contains.
All this containing water, minerals and carbon dioxide is called raw sap. 

Now it’s chlorophyll’s turn! 
The chlorophyll in the leaves has all the necessary ingredients for photosynthesis to take place and when it receives sunlight, the process begins by transforming the raw sap into elaborated sap, which also circulates around the plant and works as food. 
All plants feed from elaborated sap, and they store it in their roots, like a carrot. Or in their fruit, like an apple or a pear. 

Now we know how photosynthesis takes place but…
Why is it so important?

Without plants, there would not be life on Earth, we wouldn't have oxygen to breathe or food to feed on. You already know that herbivores eat plants and carnivores, eat herbivores. Plants are fundamental for the food chain. And they are also fundamental for our respiration. Actually, when humans breathe, we turn oxygen into carbon dioxide, quite the opposite of when plants perform photosynthesis. A curious fact you need to know is that, at night, because plants don’t have sunlight to photosynthesise, they breathe like humans do. They take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Remember that!

And one last thing so you understand the importance of photosynthesis. When plants absorb dirty and contaminated gases, they transform them into pure air, into oxygen! This way, they clean the atmosphere and all nature. Plants are the best solution to fight against contamination, don’t you think?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B0apT6VZKk&t=29s

Hello friends! Welcome to a new Happy Learning video. 
Today, we’re going to meet animals that have eight legs, and are a little scary! Today, we’re going to meet.. arachnids! 

Same as insects, arachnids are invertebrates and belong to the arthropods. But don’t get confused! Arachnids are part of a different animal group than insects, while insects have six legs, arachnids have eight! Like you can see in these images. 

Spiders, scorpions and dust mites are part of the arachnid family, and share a number of characteristics that we need to know. 

They have four pairs of articulated legs, they don’t have antennae or wings, but they do have a pair of clamps by their mouth called chelicerae (kelicera) that they use to hold their prey. 
A fun fact about arachnids is that they can’t chew, so they swallow their prey by sucking them in. They suck the soft parts as if with a straw. They are carnivores, and spiders and scorpions feed from insects, other arachnids and sometimes small reptiles and mammals. 

An Arachnid’s body is divided in two parts: cephalothorax, consisting of their head, and thorax, joined in a single segment, and the abdomen, that can be segmented, or not. 

Arachnids breathe through traqueas or pulmonary sacs. 
And when they’re born, they look the same as they do when they are adults, but of course, they are much smaller. 

Scorpions are the biggest arachnids, the largest ones can measure up to 20cm. 
They have huge chelicerae (kelicera) in their heads they use them to grab their prey, before they inject venom with their sting at the end of their tail. 

Spiders are the most popular arachnids, but also the scariest. Most of them are venomous, but very few are truly dangerous for human beings. The truth is spiders are astonishing animals. 
Also! Apart from being able to produce their famous spider web, they are able to hunt their prey in multiple ways, look look!

Dust mites are the least popular arachnids, because they are so small you can’t see them at a glance, they are microscopic, but what is true is that they’re everywhere!
In every house there are thousands and thousands of dust mites… 

Well, now we know a little more about arachnids, the truth is they are very strange and mysterious animals. But, as for everything else, they are important for balance of life, of this marvellous life.

ZuvcClFP60k,Trump speaks on Education Department cuts: &quot;States run education&quot;,LiveNOW from FOX,UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,2025-03-12T17:15:22Z,"President Donald Trump was asked about the cuts coming to the Department of Education during a sit-down meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin in the Oval Office. 

""When we cut, we want to cut the people who aren't working or who aren't doing a good job,"" Trump said. 

Trump's remarks come after reports that half of the Education Department workforce will be terminated. 

""We want education to be moved back where the states run education, where the parents of the children will run education, where governors who are doing a very good job will run education,"" Trump added.

When Trump took office, the agency's workforce numbered 4,133 employees. That will shrink to around 2,183 workers, the department said in a news release. 

About 259 employees were accepted into the deferred resignation program and another 313 accepted buyouts. Remaining workers impacted by the reductions will be placed on administrative leave beginning March 21. 

Education Secretary Linda McMahon additionally sent a letter to all staff on her first day on the job in March saying she will lead a ""momentous final mission"" to send education back to the states. 

""Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,"" McMahon said in a statement.

Every few years, countries around the world compete in global rankings to see which nation is deemed to have the best school system in the world. Schools in Asia often get the best results, and other countries like Estonia and Canada are also highly praised. But in many parts of the world there are often huge barriers to getting children into the classroom at all, such as poverty, climate change, and war.

On this episode of The Global Story, Lucy Hockings speaks to the BBC's Sean Coughlan and Professor John Jerrim, from University College London, about which countries have the most successful education systems in the world and what others can learn from them.

8FCnF-EjUDk,Nearly half of Education Department staff to be &#39;eliminated&#39;,LiveNOW from FOX,UCJg9wBPyKMNA5sRDnvzmkdg,2025-03-11T21:29:33Z,"Department of Education staff are slated to receive ""reduction in force"" notices Tuesday ahead of nearly half of its staff getting terminated, Fox News Digital learned. 

Earlier in the day, a memo was sent to all Education Department employees informing them that DOE offices will be closed Tuesday evening through Wednesday due to ""security reasons.""

Personnel with the Education Department are set to receive ""reduction in force"" notices Tuesday evening, a source familiar told Fox News Digital Tuesday afternoon. The department will see nearly half of its staff eliminated. 

President Donald Trump repeatedly has said he would like to see the states hold control over individual education systems, including campaigning on the issue ahead of the 2024 election. 

""I want to close up Department of Education, move education back to the states. … Of the 50 (states), I would bet that 35 would do great. And 15 of them, or, you know, 20 of them, will be as good as Norway. You know, Norway is considered great,"" Trump said in August 2024, while noting left-wing states such as California could struggle if he does eliminate the Department of Education.

--

Isn’t it odd that, when something’s funny, you might show your teeth, change your breathing, become weak and achy in some places, and maybe even cry? In other words, why do we do this bizarre thing that is laughter? Since there’s no archaeological record of laughter, it’s impossible to say exactly how and why it evolved, but scientists have some theories. Sasha Winkler digs into the reflex.

Science Bob’s top secret at home elephant toothpaste recipe:

A clean 16 ounce (473 ml) plastic soda bottle or a water bottle.

6 Ounces of 20-volume hydrogen peroxide liquid (20-volume is a 6% solution that is stronger than what you find in most pharmacies. It is typically used for lightening hair and is found at many beauty supply stores. You can use the 3% hydrogen peroxide found in pharmacies, but the reaction will be a bit smaller)

1 Tablespoon (15ml –  one packet) of dry yeast

3+ Tablespoons (15 ml) of warm water

Liquid dishwashing soap

Food coloring



Science Teacher Version:

BIG Elephant Toothpaste Reaction

CAUTION: This reaction uses dangerous chemicals thatch cause chemical burns or even blindness. This demonstration should only be done by by trained professionals.

In a 5L flask:
250 ml 30% (not 30 volume) hydrogen peroxide
30ml liquid dish soap
30ml food coloring.

Add
75ml sodium iodide solution (2M)

The foam may have unreacted peroxide which could cause a chemical burn and so it should not be touched.

I collected data at the carnival for a full day.  Then I used that information to figure out which games are the biggest scams using science to analyze them and show you how to beat them.  I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.

We experience a similar effect on a merry-go-round or in a car when it makes a turn. This is a fun demo to try yourself at home. Just do it outside or your parents will hate me!

First, you become the size of an ant, where the world feels gigantic. Then, you shrink to the size of bacteria, where water feels like thick syrup. But what if you go even further—to the size of an atom, a proton, or even smaller? At some point, you reach your Schwarzschild radius, where your mass is so concentrated that you become a black hole.

How would the world look at each of these scales? And what happens if you try to fight an ant when you're that dense? Watch to find out!

Pediatrician Nadine Burke Harris explains that the repeated stress of abuse, neglect and parents struggling with mental health or substance abuse issues has real, tangible effects on the development of the brain. This unfolds across a lifetime, to the point where those who’ve experienced high levels of trauma are at triple the risk for heart disease and lung cancer. An impassioned plea for pediatric medicine to confront the prevention and treatment of trauma, head-on.

The things we eat and drink on a daily basis can impact our health in big ways. Too many carbohydrates, for instance, can lead to insulin resistance, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease and Type 2 Diabetes. But what are carbs, exactly? And what do they do to our bodies? Richard J. Wood explains.

I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals.

We address the “calories in- calories out” (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.

I never used to care about my gut health, but it turns out it's super important. I recently spoke to Sophie Medlin on my podcast Deep Dive so I wanted to share all the useful advice I picked up from here. So this video is all about the science of gut health and what we can do to look after it. Enjoy x

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.

Robert F. Kennedy is receiving a lot of pushback for his ideas on health and reform. As secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, his ideas would radically change the US healthcare system. In this video, I’m going to share some of the changes I would make to address the current healthcare crisis and improve America’s health.  

0:00 Introduction: RFK healthcare policy
1:22 Institutional foods 
2:35 Subsidized foods 
3:54 Vote for me!
4:25 GRAS
5:00 Food fortification
5:35 Tax money and drugs 
6:55 End the rounding rule
7:47 Sun phobia 

RFK has the following goals for healthcare reform in America:
1. Clean up the corruption
2. Get back to science-based evidence 
3. End chronic disease

He will be actively working against big food companies, big chemical companies, and big pharma, so naturally, he’s getting a lot of pushback. The U. S. spends over 4.1 trillion dollars each year on healthcare, yet we’re at the bottom as far as health. Why?

Here's what I think can improve America’s health!

1. Change the institutional foods
Prepackaged foods are given to people in nursing homes, prisons, schools, hospitals, and other public institutions. These institutional foods are very low-quality, highly processed foods. The health of the people in these institutions would quickly improve by simply removing the refined sugars, starches, and oils from their diets.

2. Address the subsidized foods 
Subsidized foods are paid for by taxpayers. Corn, soy, wheat, sugar, and rice are the most highly subsidized foods. Changing the types of foods that are subsidized and investing in small farmers can significantly improve this problem. 

3. Changing GRAS 
“Generally recognized as safe” is a term used by the FDA for products that have been safety tested by their own manufacturers. To avoid conflict of interest, these tests should be conducted by third-party independent companies.

4. Change food fortification
Synthetic folic acid and iron fortification of food can cause serious problems for many people. 

5. Disallow tax dollars from being used for drugs 
Every year, 40 billion dollars of taxpayer money is used to pay for medical research to develop new drugs. 

6. The rounding rule
If a product contains less than .5 grams of an ingredient, it can be rounded down to 0. This is misleading and should be eliminated. People need to be more aware of what's really in their food. Companies also need to be forced to raise the quality of the ingredients in their products.

7. End sun phobia
Sun phobia paired with low RDAs for vitamin D is contributing to massive vitamin D deficiency in the population, putting people at risk for disease.

Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients, so he can focus on educating people as a full-time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

She is also an expert in how diet and exercise impact muscle and whole-body health and longevity. Dr. Lyon is a bestselling author and public educator. We discuss how healthy skeletal muscle promotes longevity, brain health, disease prevention, ideal body composition, and the health of other organs and bodily systems.

She makes specific nutritional recommendations for optimal health: what to eat, how much to eat, the timing of meals, the essential need for adequate quality protein (including animal and plant-based options), supplementation, and how our dietary requirements change with age. She explains why specific types of resistance training are essential to build and maintain muscle and overall metabolic health. She also describes how to include resistance training as part of your exercise regimen — regardless of age or sex. 

She also provides specific mindset tools to encourage sustained adherence to healthy eating and exercise practices. Women and men of all ages will benefit from Dr. Lyon’s practical, evidence-based protocols to improve muscle and whole-body appearance, function, and health.

Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.

How much power do your food choices really have over your health? You probably already know that your diet can hugely influence how well you feel, but did you know that the food you choose to eat can change the make-up of your entire body, all the way down to the health of your cells?

This week, Dr William Li returns to the podcast for the 4th time.  He is an internationally renowned physician, food scientist and bestselling author of two books, including his latest ‘Eat to Beat Your Diet: Burn Fat, Heal Your Metabolism & Live Longer’. Dr Li’s ground-breaking work has led to the development of more than 30 new medical treatments and has impacted the care of more than 70 different diseases, including cancer, type II diabetes, blindness, heart disease and obesity. And, his TED Talk, ‘Can We Eat to Starve Cancer?’ has had more than 11 million views.

In this engaging and enlightening conversation, Dr Li shares his expertise with his trademark clarity and enthusiasm. His unique ability to break down complex scientific concepts into relatable analogies makes the information accessible to anyone.

We explore the intricate relationship between what we eat and how our bodies function. We discuss how certain foods can stimulate and protect our vital stem cells, which enhances our body's natural ability to regenerate and heal. We also discuss how some foods can improve everything from our blood vessel health to the function of our brains. 

Dr Li also sheds light on some common myths surrounding metabolism, the importance of personalised nutrition and the very ‘modern’ issue of over-consuming calories. As always, Dr Li shares some of his top practical tips to help.

I thoroughly enjoyed talking to William again. He is passionate, incredibly knowledgeable and wants to empower each and every one of us to be active, engaged participants in our health. I hope you enjoy listening.

We also explore how fasting, deliberate cold exposure and spending time in nature can impact metabolic health, how to control food cravings and how to assess your metabolic health using blood testing, continuous glucose monitors and other tools. 

Metabolic dysfunction is a leading cause of chronic disease, obesity and reduced lifespan around the world. Conversely, improving your mitochondrial and metabolic health can positively affect your health span and longevity.

Why do we find it so hard to exercise despite knowing how good it is for us? Is sitting really the new smoking? And what can we learn about movement from studying populations who live more traditional lifestyles?

My guest today is the brilliant Daniel Lieberman, Professor of Biological Science and Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. His research studies how and why the human body is the way that it is, focusing on the evolution of physical activities such as walking and running and their relevance to health and disease. He has published more than 200 peer-reviewed papers and three books, including his most recent, Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved To Do is Healthy and Rewarding.

In this conversation, we cover so many fascinating topics and explore the powerful idea that humans have not actually evolved to exercise.

We compare the sitting habits of modern humans with more traditional societies and Daniel shares why it may not be how long we sit for that is causing us problems, but more the way in which we choose to sit. We also talk about the profound importance of maintaining strength and activity as we age, the relationship between movement and cancer, the truth about barefoot running and minimalist shoes and the concept of 'mismatch diseases' - this idea that our modern environment is in direct conflict with our evolutionary design, and the impact this is having on our wellbeing.

Throughout the conversation, Daniel challenges many common beliefs that exist around health, and offers us evidence-based, practical strategies for building a healthier relationship with physical activity. 

Whether you're interested in the science of movement, looking to build sustainable exercise habits into your life, or simply curious about how our ancestors lived, this is a truly wonderful conversation with one of the world’s most highly respected experts. I hope you enjoy listening.

QYAgf_lfio4,Using Your Mind to Control Your Physical Health &amp; Longevity | Dr. Ellen Langer,Andrew Huberman,UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg,2025-02-03T13:00:38Z,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. Ellen Langer, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Harvard University and the world’s leading researcher on the mind-body connection and the power our thinking has on our physical health. She explains how specific ways of framing and asking questions about the world shape our physical health and rate of aging. Dr. Langer also explains how our perception of time and control significantly impact our rate of physical healing, hormones, immune system, and longevity. She describes mindfulness as a way of framing life, not simply a meditation or other practice, and discusses data showing how to use one’s mind to overcome health challenges and achieve remarkable outcomes. Dr. Langer is a luminary and pioneer in researching the relationship between the mind and body with scientific rigor. Her work and our discussion are applicable to women and men of all ages and walks of life.

YdMCL9_UTE4,Mental health and resilience - the secrets of inner strength | DW Documentary,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2024-01-20T17:00:21Z,"Around one billion people struggle with stress-related illness globally - and that figure is rising. What protects those with good mental health? Is their resilience innate? Or is the ability to withstand chronic stress and crisis something that can be learned?

In the search for answers, the film visits some of the leading figures in resilience research. The filmmakers also interview epigeneticists and neuroscientists. In the largest European resilience center in Mainz, Germany, researchers conduct a long-term study to explore the mechanisms deployed by people who enjoy good mental health despite stress and crisis. In southern France, the film meets Boris Cyrulnik, a pioneer of resilience research. His credo: when it comes to resilient behavior, it’s not just down to us - society and politics also have a responsibility to create appropriate conditions for stable psychological health. And the film tells the moving story of two families united by tragedy: following the violent death of their two sons, who were friends, they struggle to find their way back to some semblance of normal life.

Our experiences, our environment and our genes - all influence our powers of mental resilience. Resilience isn’t a magic word or a promise of happiness, but a life-long learning process.

_Zbqo_hrwXc,The intestine - The body’s underappreciated control center and gut health | DW Documentary,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2025-01-09T17:00:37Z,"The intestine is a true marvel. This organ’s complex functions extend far beyond the mere processing of food. The intestine affects the immune system and also has a powerful effect on our emotional well-being.

If a person’s gut is doing well, that person is doing well. If the gut is doing poorly, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation -- or depression. So, what can be done to protect and strengthen the gut?

This documentary follows people for whom the gut plays a special role in their lives. They speak openly about what is sometimes a taboo subject.

Jana Eberhart has a stressful everyday life. The student works as a model and is a passionate about sports. In fact, she’s about to take part in an Ironman competition. Can a change in diet strengthen her gut so that she can perform better? Sports and nutrition consultant Dr. Jens Freese accompanies Jana on her project over an extended period of time. What impact will dietary changes and other interventions have? 

For actor and fitness influencer Philipp Stehler, careful management of the gut is essential. He lives with ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal inflammation condition. This disease almost cost him his life. His large intestine had to be surgically removed. Philipp Stehler talks openly about his life then and now. While his diet used to consist mainly of meat and protein shakes, he now eats a vegan diet and practices yoga and meditation every day.

Carina Speck has been living with irritable bowel syndrome or IBS for 13 years. Bloating, diarrhea and stomach cramps accompany her in everything she does. But the social media manager doesn't want to isolate herself because of it. On Instagram and TikTok, she gives tips on things like traveling with IBS. Dr. Miriam Stengel from SRH Klinikum Sigmaringen guides her, with recommendations on how she can get a better handle on her symptoms.

QpoaNklmRPc,Oral Health Protocols,Andrew Huberman,UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg,2024-02-13T22:01:07Z,"Dubbed by ElevenLabs

The new Huberman Lab episode is all about oral health. It covers everything from brushing and flossing, as well as how to repair cavities without drilling (which depends on how deep they are into the tooth, of course), as well as the oral microbiome, which is critical for whole body health, gum health, the legitimate concerns of being a mouth breather, especially during sleep, and much more.

Researching this episode has led me to significantly revamp my oral health protocols. The good news is all of them are easy, take a limited amount of time, and are either zero cost or will save you costs.

Many of the suggested protocols from experts are counterintuitive. The field of oral health has undergone significant strides in recent years, and the episode reflects the latest.

1CxJVdeyltw,How to Improve Skin Health &amp; Appearance,Andrew Huberman,UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg,2024-07-01T12:00:01Z,"In this episode, I discuss skin health appearance and why both are important indicators of the health status of your immune system, gut microbiome, and other organ systems. I explain why sunlight is essential for skin and hormone health and how excessive sunlight can accelerate skin aging and cause certain skin cancers. I discuss the different types of sunscreens (physical, chemical, and mineral-based) and potential health concerns of the chemicals found in some (but not all) sunscreens.

I also discuss the importance of getting your skin (and not just moles) checked for pre-cancerous and cancer growths, the role of nutrition and lifestyle factors that improve skin health and appearance, and how to improve your skin by reducing local and systemic inflammation and supporting your microbiome. 

I explain what works to improve your skin's youthfulness and appearance, including reducing wrinkles, sagging, and pore size. I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.

I also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions. 

This episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.

8Q-oZT0mIPs,Pope Francis Health Update: Signs of Improvement Amid Ongoing Health Concerns,moneycontrol,UChftTVI0QJmyXkajQYt2tiQ,2025-03-13T12:00:19Z,"Pope Francis, aged 88, is showing signs of improvement as he nears one month in Rome’s Gemelli hospital, though doctors warn his recovery remains fragile due to age and underlying health conditions. Admitted in mid-February with pneumonia, the Pope is currently reliant on non-invasive ventilation and high-flow oxygen therapy, treatments often seen as precursors to intensive care. Doctors expect a full recovery from pneumonia but note that his chronic conditions could impact long-term health. Infectious disease expert Loredana Sarmati emphasized that Francis will require respiratory support for several more days or weeks. The Vatican has not confirmed his post-recovery schedule, though observers expect a slower pace with fewer engagements. Francis has been out of the public eye since early February and will mark the 12th anniversary of his election on March 13 from the hospital. Prayers and vigils continue outside the hospital as his followers hope for his recovery.

tLRCS48Ens4,Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand &amp; Assess Your Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series,Andrew Huberman,UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg,2023-09-06T12:00:50Z,"This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group.

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, and over-thinking, as well as how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate.

This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns, and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional.

The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.

Tiesto has one of the most diverse portfolios released by any artist in my opinion. From Trance, to progressive house, to Brazilian bass, his career has maintained longevity as well as relevancy throughout. The Business is super unique and the official music video actually featured Casey Frey (who is hilarious). Anyways here is the official lyric video for it that is visually STUNNING (as always ofc with our LVs on Prox ty very much). HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY! :)

Lyrics for Tiesto - The Business (Official Lyric Video):
Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Mama pls don’t worry bout me 
Cause I’m about to let my heart speak 
My friends keep telling me to leave this 
So let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Back and forth 
Back and forth  
with the bullshit 
I know I said it before 
I don’t mean it 
It’s been a while since I had your attention 
so it might hurt to hear this  

Dreams we have don’t ever fall away 
but we can’t live em if we stay the same  
And I can’t do this for another day 
So let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business 

Let’s get down let’s get down to business 
Give you one more night, one night to get this 
We’ve had a million million nights just like this 
so let’s get down, let’s get down to business

Lyrics:

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Verse 1]
Mama, please don't worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm about to let my heart speak
My friends keep telling me to leave this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you onе more night, one more night to gеt this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business, yeah

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, back and forth with the bullshit
I know I said it before, I don't mean it
It's been a while since I had your attention
So it might hurt to hear this

[Bridge]
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Dreams we have don't ever fall away
We can't live 'em if we stay the same
And I can't do this for another day
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, yeah

The highest quality stones can be worth tens of thousands of dollars per carat. Miners have fought over these treasures for centuries, but in the past decade, foreign investors have modernized and consolidated the industry. The newcomers have brought safety and new jobs to the area, but there’s little left over for the communities around the mines. So what happens when foreign investors take over a $150 million industry? And can local miners gain a piece of it back?

It relies on EU nations, Mexico, Canada, China, India, and many other countries for products like seafood, fruit, olive oil, sugar, and cheese. President Donald Trump is threatening tariffs on many of these countries, which could make food more expensive for Americans at grocery stores. We explore where America gets its food and what's at stake if trade relations are jeopardized.

Andrew Gomez was still in college when he started his trucking business, AJG Transport. Now, he’s grown from 2 trucks to a fleet of 80 with over $1 million a month in gross revenue. He’s sharing his tips to start a trucking company with fast growth potential in this episode. 

Andrew comes from an entrepreneurial family. His brother owned his own trucking business, too, and his parents had owned their own businesses before, as well, including one in the trucking industry. Their issue was that they didn’t know how to scale the company, something Andrew set about discovering when he started AJG Transport. 

Even with these knowledge resources to draw on, Andrew knew starting a trucking company wouldn’t be easy. He got himself a solid start by finding a niche market delivering for Amazon and invested all his profits back into the business to drive steady growth. The company’s big breakthrough happened when Andrew started building relationships with corporate executives to land big-ticket jobs. In this interview, he’ll share his advice for how to break into the corporate world as a small business owner and the strategy that made the difference in securing these jobs for AJG Transport. 

AJG Transport has been on an upward growth trajectory since it launched, but that doesn’t mean growing the company was easy. Andrew had plenty of long days and sleepless nights on his journey to building a 7-figure a month business. He’ll share the sacrifices he made to build his business, the mistakes he’s made along the way, and how he overcame those challenges to get to where he is today.

Editor's Note: A previous version of this video incorrectly stated Mohammad Ashraf's method of cutting metal. He is using gas cutting, also known as oxy-fuel cutting, which does not require electrical power. Also, at 12:57, the caption incorrectly states the amount paid to the families of deceased workers. Rizwan Farooqi says they pay 2,100,000 PKR per worker, which is equivalent to about $7,500.

Since 2007, Lego has released dozens of sets that cost over $300. The most expensive Star Wars sets cost $850. And prices for vintage Lego sets can reach over $1,000. These high prices have caught the attention of thieves, who in some cases have stolen about $300,000 worth of Lego. So, how did we get here? How did Lego go from a children's toy to a collector's item? And why is it so expensive?

🎤 Lyrics: Tiësto - The Business
[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Verse]
Mama, please don't worry 'bout me
I'm about to let my heart speak
Friends keep telling me I need this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one morе night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just likе this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, back and forth with the bullshit
You know I said it before, I don't mean it
It's been a while since I had your attention
So in my heart, you're in it (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Dreams we had, don't ever follow it
We can't leave away it's still the same
And I can't do this for another day
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, yeah

WHAT BROUGHT ME TO YOUTUBE: I worked at Goldman Sachs, in Private Equity, and built up Main Street Holding Company. After being in Wall Street for so long, I got tired of managing hundreds of millions for the rich. Investing was for the few not the many. F that. You all are the reason I do this. We as a society need to get rich together. My mission is to create 100,000 business owners, I hope you’re one.

Starting young, Vivek trained with stockbrokers, built his first investment portfolio, and even launched a tech startup at 19, which he sold to a multinational corporation by 22!

Today, he owns multiple businesses mega entertainment, an event management firm, Karma infrastructure, a real estate company.

He manages the Oberoi Family Office, focusing on equities, private equity deals, and real estate investments. His strategy includes a “steady and sexy” investment model—60% in stable assets and 40% in high-return ventures.

One of his biggest business successes is Solitario Diamonds, with 18 stores across India and a growing presence in the luxury jewellery market.

Vivek’s entrepreneurial success makes his net worth over 1200 crores! Which is more than Pushpa star Allu Arjun and Ranbir Kapoor.

William Milliken has a background in digital marketing and spent much of his career focusing on home service businesses. As time progressed, however, he realized he could make more money if he were to start a home service business of his own. He’s now generating over $200K in monthly revenue by entering the dog waste removal industry. 

Will discovered the niche business idea of waste scooping after watching YouTube videos that circled around the concept. With over 65 million households owning dogs in the U.S., he saw it as a profitable opportunity to enter into a business with little competition and high growth potential. 

He first targeted larger cities, such as Seattle. He sets up yearly contracts with each dog owner to remove the waste in their yard—with some contracts ranging from $20-30K annually. With the help of tailored marketing resources, his number of weekly clients quickly snowballed to over 2,000.

In this episode, learn how to harness the power of Meta ads, Google, and word of mouth to grow and scale a small business. Will also explains how he set up the business to be self-sufficient enough to run on its own even if he goes traveling for over six months.

Lyrics:
You were the right way
I was just waiting ' for you to look at me
Is there a wrong time
Baby, I'm guessing
Just let me know

Well, it's been a long time
Since you've been lonely
So what will I do
You are the right one
And I'm just the boy who is looking at you

Peut-être une prochaine fois, au détour d'un bar
So what will I do
Avec quatre grammes dans l'sang
À plus mec, bonne soirée

I tried the wrong way
I was just guessing, biding my time
You are the only one I can picture by my side

hQapSz9AYv8,Inside North Korea After 5 Years of Isolation,Mike Okay,UCpp3cHR9TWVyXqL1AVw4XkA,2025-02-28T16:48:56Z,"For the first time in years, North Korea is finally opening up to foreign visitors, and I had the chance to go inside. Rason, a special economic zone near the borders of China and Russia, is one of the few places where outsiders can visit, and I wanted to see firsthand what’s happening there.

During COVID, North Korea shut itself off completely, enforcing some of the strictest border controls in the world. Now, trade is resuming, and limited tourism is back. But what’s life really like after years of isolation? In this video, I take you inside North Korea’s Rason zone, exploring markets, meeting locals, and seeing what’s changed since the border closure.

Join me as I step into one of the most secretive places on Earth. 🇰🇵


enjoy, mike x

Countries are categorized into Red (complete ban), Orange (restricted travel with mandatory interviews), and Yellow (60 days to address deficiencies). These restrictions focus on national security concerns, including inadequate vetting and passport security. Unlike Trump's previous Muslim ban, these new measures target a broader range of countries and could affect global travel significantly.

More than 100,000 people call this unique city home, living in high-rise buildings along a narrow strip of land between steep mountains and the polluted brown River. It’s truly mind-blowing to see how Yanjin has adapted to its natural environment, with its residents making the most of every inch of space available. The towering mountains in every direction make it feel as though the city is trapped in a stunning, yet challenging, landscape. In all of my travels, I've never seen anything like this!

Also - this is my first time visiting rural China, and I have to admit, it’s been a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of massive cities like Beijing or Shanghai. The slower pace, tight-knit community, and the way life carries on here, despite the obvious limitations, have been truly eye-opening. 

Mainland China is full of surprises, and Yanjin is just one of the many hidden gems that I've discovered on this 18 day trip. Stay tuned for the next five videos in my China series, where I’ll be uncovering even more fascinating and lesser-known places across this incredible country! Woohoo!

Thanks to @littlechineseeverywhere for coming on this adventure with me! She makes awesome content (in English) around China!

Spookiz 스푸키즈 is a Keyring animation, which follows the lives of Cula, Frankie and all their friends whilst at school. 

Cula is a descendant of a royal Dracula family. He may seem cold-blooded and evil, but he actually wants to get close to others and become their friends. He has OCD and a complete neat freak! You may see him and his sidekick KongKong get up to no good, but he's a good soul really!

Frankie is a bit of a dull slowpoke, Frankie's appetite sometimes turns him into a bit of a monster! He grows a four-leaf clover on top of his head which is lucky charm. He's one of the kindest members of the Spookiz gang, but his appetite sometimes puts him in a foul mood if he is not full up!

Kebi is a free-minded soul and isn't one to stick to rules and formality. He's constantly energetic and bubbly and loves to tease Cula as much as he can. It is a friendly rivalry though as they truly are best buddies!

KongKong is Cula's sidekick KongKong is best described as weak to the strong and strong to the weak. He's very self conscious about his short height but by listening and trusting in Cula he feels safe and comforted.

Zizi shows gives off a stinking odour but she does not realise it. Body parts (mainly her head) often fall apart off her body, but are always easily placed back together on her. She has a secret crush on Cula and dreams of being with him always. She's incredibly shy around him and doesn't like anyone to know this.

🥒 *ABOUT BEFRS:*
Hey, I’m Sonny! I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.

If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. Peace!

tT-vg1T-6dI,Thai Street Food - $1 VS $150 Thai Curry in Bangkok!!,Mark Wiens,UCyEd6QBSgat5kkC6svyjudA,2025-03-01T11:01:12Z,"🇹🇭 Thailand’s King of Crispy Pork: https://youtu.be/zD0Y8tKCglA

Today we’re going on a huge Thai curry (known as Khao Gaeng ข้าวแกง) tour in Bangkok, from the best street food to fine dining, we’ll try Thai rice and curry at a street food stall for $1, a gourmet seafood street food stall for $5, and we’ll see how Chef Chalee transforms Thai rice and curry to an incredible gourmet level while keeping the authentic taste for $150. If you love Thai curry, this is as good as it gets!

Here are the places I ate:
 
1. Khao Gaeng Waraporn (ข้าวราดแกงวราภรณ์ https://maps.app.goo.gl/gsBQyCbdbMUJcJ1t8 ) - This Thai street food curry stall is tucked in an alley and they serve a continual stream of customers. Everything is good, but no one missed their extra crispy fried chicken. 45 THB ($1.33) 

2. Pa Tim Thai Curry (ข้าวแกงป้าติ๋ม https://maps.app.goo.gl/zDYBNBhsiK7HysUk8 ) - Aunty Tim is known for her quality and premium ingredients served on the streets of Bangkok - we’re talking river prawns and stuffed squid. And the flavors are worth every bite! 200 THB ($5.92) 

3. Wana Yook (วรรณยุค https://maps.app.goo.gl/4CfaP1FPuZgzq13d8 ) - Wana Yook is in my opinion one of the best Thai fine dining restaurant in the world, and I like it even more that Chef Chalee Kader tributes his menu to Thai rice and curry from the streets. With 1 Michelin Star, if you’re looking for uncompromised Thai food flavors, yet with exceptional quality and ingredients sourced from around Thailand, Wana Yook is a top choice. Price - approximately 4,500 THB ($133.30)

🥒 *ABOUT BEFRS:*
Hey, I’m Sonny! I’m from the US but I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer.

If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture. Peace!

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

In 2005, they ran an ad with the phrase ""I’d Hit It"", which had an unintended slang meaning. Instead of sounding cool, it became a joke, and customers mocked it online. Watch as people react to this hilarious marketing blunder! This proves why brands must understand pop culture before using trendy phrases. Have you seen a worse ad slogan?

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX, the CEO of VaynerMedia, and the Creator & CEO of VeeFriends. Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what's next in culture, business, and the internet.

Known as ""GaryVee,"" he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business. He acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how shifts in consumer attention impact the realities of the business world today. Gary's approach sits at the intersection of business and pop culture. He keenly understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

This year, Gary unveiled his seventh book, ""Day Trading Attention"" where he provides fresh insights into navigating the modern social media landscape. Gary's expertise guides readers on harnessing underpriced attention channels in the digital age. He emphasizes mastering storytelling in these arenas and highlights the ""TikTokification of Social Media,"" where content relevance surpasses follower counts. Businesses can leverage this shift to enhance their brand and boost sales. ""Day Trading Attention"" equips readers with essential skills to succeed in today's dynamic digital world. Gary also announced his first children's picture book, based on his VeeFriends characters, titled ""Meet Me in the Middle”. The picture book, which will prominently feature two VeeFriends characters, Eager Eagle and Patient Pig, delves into the emotional elements essential for nurturing children's empathy – a crucial skill for their future success.

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart – he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full-service advertising agency, VaynerMedia, which has offices in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur. VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company, which also includes Eva Nosidam Productions, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerCommerce, and Tingley Lane Trading. Gary is the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, VCR Group, VaynerWatt, ArtOfficial, Resy, and Empathy Wines. He guided Resy and Empathy to successful exits -- which he later sold to American Express and Constellation Brands, respectively. He also owns a Major League Pickleball team called the 5s, is part owner of a Big3 basketball team, and is an investor in the revival of the SlamBall League.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his daily life as a CEO through his social media channels, which have more than 44 million followers and garner over 300 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms. His podcast, ""The GaryVee Audio Experience,"" ranks among the top podcasts globally.

Gary serves on the board of MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, Global Citizen Forum, and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of charity: water. 

Gary's life ambition is to buy the New York Jets.",574204,15239,482,0.0274,0:50:44,27,"Gary Vaynerchuk, gary vee, gary vaynerchuck, garyvee",4590000,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCctXZhXmG-kf3tlIXgVZUlw

His great insight into what we don't know about marketing is adopted from his bestseller -  Seth Godin, This Is Marketing.

keCwRdbwNQY,Best marketing strategy ever! Steve Jobs Think different / Crazy ones speech (with real subtitles),Rene Brokop,UCJXgBLh6qbGFTo-2E9YQa5Q,2013-04-21T14:40:18Z,"Hey. Welcome. This is the ""Uploader"" speaking. I work with Marketing myself, via Video production. Check out my latest showreel: https://youtu.be/AS56LF6MDTk

""It honours those people who has changed the world. Some of them are living. Some of them are not. But the ones who aren't ... as you'll see ... that if they ever used a computer, it would have been a Mac.""

When Steve Jobs came back to Apple 1996, the company was in a horrible state. It had to be rebuild, rebranded and reinstated in peoples minds — what Apple was about and what they stood for. 
And so in 1997 they started the ""Think different"" campaign and that made an allmost miraculous turnover.

Since then Apple has skyrocketed!

As we navigate through the world, we are constantly being influenced by subtle design tactics that most of us aren't even aware of. These branding tactics can be found everywhere - in the layout of your favorite store, the colors of a pop-up ad, or even the design of your favorite app. But it's not just about understanding these principles. It's about considering the ethics behind their use, questioning the motives, and equipping ourselves to recognize and resist manipulation.

Nuestra estrategia debe ser un documento vivo. 

Caemos con frecuencia en el error de dar muchas de los aspectos tratados como ""demasiado básicos"" y por eso tendemos a ignorarlos.

Yo mismo he pensado alguna vez ""se perfectamente a quién me dirijo"" y he tendido a ignorar el definir a mi buyer, ERROR. Por el camino surgen dudas

La parte de identidad de marca es magia. Antes no tenía pasta para contratar a estas agencias y trataba de darle forma a la identidad por pura lógica. 

Hoy en día entiendo que hay métodos de trabajo que sencillamente nos hacen más eficaces.

Espero vuestro feedback para aplicarlo en la próxima sesión.

Espero que lo disfruten.

1KPh9K7-sPo,The Genius Marketing Trick By Five Guys,Financian,UC0Cyf-sOPE0AGY41I6andkQ,2024-10-03T21:11:56Z,"Rory Sutherland talks about the IKEA effect in marketing.

Rory Sutherland, a leading figure in the fields of advertising and behavioral economics, has extensively studied human behavior and decision-making processes. One of the concepts he has explored is known as ""The IKEA Effect,"" a phenomenon that sheds light on how people value and appreciate products more when they have invested effort into creating or customizing them.

The term ""The IKEA Effect"" derives from the well-known Swedish furniture retailer IKEA, which is renowned for its self-assembly furniture kits. When customers purchase furniture from IKEA, they are often required to assemble the pieces themselves using instructions provided in the packaging. Despite the sometimes challenging and time-consuming nature of the assembly process, customers often report a heightened sense of satisfaction and attachment to the finished product.

Sutherland's study delves into why this phenomenon occurs and what implications it has for consumer behavior and marketing strategies. One explanation is that the act of assembling furniture imbues the finished product with a greater sense of personal investment and ownership. When individuals put effort into building something themselves, they develop a sense of pride and attachment to the outcome, leading them to value it more highly than if it were simply purchased pre-assembled.

Furthermore, ""The IKEA Effect"" highlights the role of effort justification in shaping consumer perceptions and preferences. According to this theory, people tend to rationalize their investment of time and effort by attributing greater value to the end result. In the context of IKEA furniture, customers may perceive their DIY efforts as a form of labor or skill, which enhances their appreciation for the final product.

From a marketing perspective, understanding ""The IKEA Effect"" can inform product design, branding, and customer engagement strategies. By incorporating opportunities for customization, co-creation, or self-expression into their offerings, companies can tap into consumers' innate desire to invest in and take ownership of their purchases. This could involve offering DIY kits, customizable features, or interactive experiences that allow customers to personalize their products and feel a greater sense of connection to them.

Overall, Rory Sutherland's study on ""The IKEA Effect"" provides valuable insights into the psychological drivers of consumer behavior and the ways in which businesses can leverage these principles to enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and engagement. By recognizing the inherent value of effort and involvement in the consumption process, companies can create more meaningful and fulfilling experiences for their customers.

Letra:

Só restou eu sentindo saudade
E não tô curtindo essa vibe
Vai bater a falta minha em você
Só que cê nem sabe

Terminar comigo é fácil
Ficar sem mim é fase
Seu sorriso na sua foto é só marketing
Convence ninguém
Não vem me falar que tá tudo bem
Não tá nada bem

Economiza o sofrimento vai
Já tô te adiantando que saudade dói demais
Se acha que dá conta então vai
Essa é a melhor parte
Você tentando me esquecer e morrendo no quase

Economiza o sofrimento vai
Já tô te adiantando que saudade dói demais
Se acha que dá conta então vai
Essa é a melhor parte
Você tentando me esquecer e morrendo no quase

Terminar comigo é fácil
Ficar sem mim é fase
Seu sorriso na sua foto é só marketing
Convence ninguém
Não vem me falar que tá tudo bem
Não tá nada bem

Economiza o sofrimento vai
Já tô te adiantando que saudade dói demais
Se acha que dá conta então vai
Essa é a melhor parte
Você tentando me esquecer e morrendo no quase

Economiza o sofrimento vai
Já tô te adiantando que saudade dói demais
Se acha que dá conta então vai
Essa é a melhor parte
Você tentando me esquecer e morrendo no quase

Economiza o sofrimento vai
Já tô te adiantando que saudade dói demais
Se acha que dá conta então vai
Essa é a melhor parte
Você tentando me esquecer e morrendo no quase

""There are, of course, exceptions: buddies who know all about intimacy and cosiness, camaraderie and connection. But let’s state the darker and more general truth plainly: friendship is difficult for men. For every man who can claim a decent male friend, there must be at least eight who – in the honesty of their deep minds – know they have none that truly merit the term...""

There are a lot of psychological tricks and neuro-linguistic programming tips and there are millions of books and articles written about them. Many of these tricks really help professionals manipulate people and avoid being tricked by others. But are there tips that non-professionals can use on a daily basis?

Psychology is a science with certain laws one cannot ignore. Modern marketing specialists, entrepreneurs, and even swindlers realize that. Bright Side offers a few psychological tricks you can use in everyday life to make it much easier and more exciting for you to reach your goals.

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY: 
- Never start your request with the words ""Could you..."" It can cause the other person to subconsciously assume that this is a theoretical question
- If you ever want someone to feel uncomfortable, look at the middle of their forehead during the conversation.
- If someone you're talking to is trying to avoid answering a question, just make a pause in the conversation while still keeping eye contact.
- When asking a question that you want an affirmative answer to, try to nod subtly as you make your request. This trick is often used by restaurants employees to make guests buy more food, and it’s pretty effective! 
- If a person is really concentrated on a task (let's say they're in the middle of a serious phone conversation), you can extend your hand to them and get anything they’re holding at the moment.
- If you want somebody to do something for you, casually say how they probably wouldn’t even be able to do it. Most people will try really hard to prove someone wrong when it comes to doubting their capabilities.
- Here’s a good one for negotiations. If you like a person's offer in general but would like to get better conditions, pretend to be a little bit disappointed.
- As soon as your alarm clock goes off, sit up, make two fists, and yell ""Yeah!"" as if you’re a soccer player who's just scored a goal. It sounds bizarre, but it really does help you easily get out of bed feeling refreshed.
- If a person tries to pull you into an argument or some drama, say something nice to them. The ol’ “kill ‘em with kindness” trick really does stop them in their tracks.
- If you have that one lazy person on your team that slows the whole work process down, don't give them tasks by saying ""Do this."" It’s better to say ""Start with this.""
- If someone is staring at you in the subway (happens all-too often, right?), just look at their shoes. Don't give up, keep gazing! It’ll drive them crazy!
- If someone has done something wrong, but you don’t wanna sound too accusing, change the way you construct your sentences.
- If you didn't get a good night's sleep, tell yourself that you did. I know, it sounds like nonsense, but it does work 100% if you say it with meaning!
- People are better at remembering what happened at the beginning and end of the day. As for anything that went on in between, it gets blurry.

Narcissism isn’t just a personality type that shows up in advice columns; it’s actually a set of traits classified and studied by psychologists. But what causes it? And can narcissists improve on their negative traits? W. Keith Campbell describes the psychology behind the elevated and sometimes detrimental self-involvement of narcissists.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

** if I explained poorly, its been 3 years since I graduated and I just synthesised all my notes LMFAOO via AI. This is a pretty realistic view of what they will teach u, they dont teach u how to manipulate people etc.  Im much less versed on these concepts (my notes)  than I am other psychological theories and whatnot which I did not learn in my degree but “in the field” — aka what I usually talk about in my videos! obviously this scratches the surface and we can’t realistically summarise 3 years into 16 mins, let alone a couple of videos. ur degree also depends on what courses ur selecting too in year 3. 

Year 1: foundational knowledge - Introduces basic psychological concepts and research methods.
Year 2: Builds on foundational knowledge with more advanced topics and introduces practical applications + advanced research methods. 
Year 3: Advanced Topics and Dissertation - Forensic psychology, neuropsychology, health psychology, educational psychology, etc. 
Year 4: HONOURS + research 

IMO I do think you can study everything yourself. I never went on to do masters etc, because this is not my chosen field and I knew I would work for myself and I would never be a psychologist. I just knew if I understood psychology I will always make money and have an edge as an entrepreneur!

jLWpuLH3t6k,The Psychology of The Fool,Eternalised,UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA,2023-05-25T17:38:34Z,"The fool is one of the most relatable, intriguing and recurring figures in the world. There have been fools who have caused surprise and laughter since time immemorial. We worship folly by seeing it in people and in the world and by willingly displaying it in ourselves. It is one of the timeless archetypes, which we all inherit at birth.

Many of us suffer from the absence of the fool in our lives. Frenetic and upright, we take ourselves too seriously. As William Shakespeare said, “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.” Forgetting that playfulness is a basic human need, we wonder why we so easily become bored and exhausted, losing all capacity for spontaneity, authenticity, and passion. The antidote to this would be to give the fool archetype some space in our lives.

“The soul demands your folly; not your wisdom.” - Carl Jung

Men feel anxious, on the verge of feeling impotent, helpless, frustrated, unloved, unappreciated, and often ashamed of being masculine. Something vital is missing in the many lives of men. 

For students of mythology and Jungian psychology, there is hope. The external deficiencies we face—absent fathers, immature role models, a lack of meaningful rituals, and the scarcity of ritual elders—can be overcome if we look within ourselves, and turn towards the archetypes of the mature masculine within our unconscious. 

In King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine, Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette explore the difference between Boy psychology or the archetypes of immature masculinity and Man psychology or the archetypes of mature masculinity, as well as their shadow sides.

“The more beautiful, competent, and creative we become, the more we seem to invite the hostility of our superiors, or even of our peers. What we are really being attacked by is the immaturity in human beings who are terrified of our advances on the road toward masculine or feminine fullness of being.”

D_u9KbOmzhM,The Psychology of Knowing Yourself,Eternalised,UCqos1tl0RntucGGtPXNxkkA,2025-02-25T16:38:31Z,"Carl Jung published his book Psychological Types in 1921, introducing four functions of consciousness: thinking, feeling, sensation and intuition, and the two attitudes through which these four functions are deployed: introversion and extraversion. 

Jung’s functions follow a fourfold structure, which is typical of the archetype of the Self. We are dealing with the archetype of the differentiation of consciousness, which helps you to become who you are meant to be. Jung combined function types and attitude types to describe, in turn, eight function-attitudes. These were the psychological types in Jung’s original description. However, very few of us, even among psychologists, can recognise the eight function-attitudes described by Jung.

Jungian psychologist John Beebe expands on Jung’s work on types, extending the fourfold model to an eightfold model of personality, as well as associating an archetype with each type. The first four archetypes are: the hero/heroine, the father/mother, the puer aeternus/puella aeterna, and the anima/animus. These are ego-syntonic, as they align harmoniously with the needs and goals of the ego. As for the other four function-attitudes, we enter the realm of the shadow, or the ego-dystonic personality, which includes: the opposing personality, the senex/witch, the trickster and the demonic/daimonic personality.

We may see these eight archetypes as different personalities within the vast theatre of the unconscious. They too have a role to play in our lives, seeking to express themselves outwardly. It is by integrating these archetypes of the collective unconscious that we truly become an individual. This process is at the heart of individuation. It is the journey of discovering your essence—who you were meant to be. 

When an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. If we do not gain control over the images within us, we run the risk of them gaining control over us.

Seduction is a game of psychology, not beauty, and it is within the grasp of any person to become a master at the game.

A seducer does not turn the power off and on—every social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction. There is never a moment to waste.

Seducers are never self-absorbed. Their gaze is directed outward, not inward. Pleasure is a feeling of being taken past our limits, of being overwhelmed—by another person, by an experience.
Finally, seducers are completely amoral in their approach to life.

🎓 ABOUT ROBERT GREENE:

Robert Greene is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, and The 50th Law. His highly anticipated fifth book, Mastery, examines the lives of great historical figures such as Charles Darwin, Mozart, Paul Graham and Henry Ford and distills the traits and universal ingredients that made them masters.

Even though it’s a natural and healthy part of sexuality, society often treats it as a taboo subject. In this video, we’re breaking down the walls of discomfort to explore questions you might have but feel too shy to ask.  

Have you ever wondered how masturbation impacts your emotions, relationships, or overall well-being? Or why it can sometimes bring up feelings of guilt, even when it’s a private act? Whether you’re single, in a relationship, or just curious, we’ll explore the complexities of this topic, from its psychological benefits to the moments it might create challenges.  

Quick disclaimer: We’ve discussed the darker aspects of masturbation, like addiction, in previous videos. This time, we’re looking at a more balanced perspective, showing both the pros and the cons. So if you’ve ever felt confused or conflicted about this subject, stick around—we’ve got you covered.  

✨ Topics covered in this video include:  
- How cultural or personal beliefs can make masturbation feel guilt-inducing  
- Why people masturbate even in satisfying relationships  
- The role of masturbation as a coping mechanism for stress  
- Its benefits for singles, from health perks to sexual self-discovery  
- How sex therapy uses masturbation as a tool for healing  

We hope this video gives you new insights into a topic often swept under the rug. Masturbation is not just about pleasure; it’s also about understanding yourself, your body, and your emotions.  

💬 Did you resonate with any of these points? Let us know in the comments! Share your thoughts, ask your questions, or simply join the conversation. Your voice matters, and we’re here to create a safe and supportive space to destigmatize this important topic.

We discuss how desiring, pursuing, saving, and spending money impact our psychology and perception of wealth. We explore why people tend to either overspend or oversave and examine the most common mistakes made in the pursuit of financial freedom. Additionally, we discuss how to best use money — and one’s relationship with it — as a tool to create psychological security, freedom, and a deeper sense of life purpose.

We also delve into the impact of purchases, social media, and wealth signaling on our internal reward circuits, the dangers of using money as a gauge of career progress or self-worth, and the healthiest psychological stances to adopt while building wealth at any level. By the end of the episode, listeners will have gained numerous practical tools for making smarter financial decisions and should have a clearer understanding of the role money plays in their psychology, happiness, and life.

How does insecurity hurt others? 

Licensed therapist Jonathan Decker and filmmaker Alan Seawright are revisiting Loki, not as a villain but as a hero. They’re taking a look at his heroic arc in the Loki TV series and how the god of mischief goes on a very human journey. Jonathan explains how Loki’s insecurity and self-loathing hurts others, and he raves about Mobius, who’s basically a therapist! Alan gives high praise to the production design of the show as well as Tom Hiddleston’s complex performances as his character evolves.

🔍 In this video, we unravel the layers of AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and their applications in tools like #ChatGPT and Google #Bard

We first go through how AI is a broad field of study that encompasses #MachineLearning as a sub-field.

We then break down Machine Learning into supervised and unsupervised models, using real-world examples to illustrate their functions and differences.

We move deeper into Deep Learning: Learn about artificial neural networks and the power of semi-supervised learning in applications like fraud detection in banking.

Then we delve into Generative AI, differentiating it from discriminative models and demonstrating its capabilities in creating new, innovative outputs.

Finally we walk through Large Language Models (LLMs) and uncover the significance of LLMs in AI, their pre-training processes, and their customization for specific industry applications

It's the mid-21st century and man has developed a new type of computer that is aware of its own existence. This computer has been utilized to help man cope with the melting of the polar ice caps and the submerging of many of its coastal cities. This form of artificial intelligence has been used in robots, and one such android, a young boy (Haley Joel Osment) is about to take an emotional journey to find out if he can ever be anything more than a machine.

s0dMTAQM4cw,Artificial intelligence and algorithms: pros and cons | DW Documentary (AI documentary),DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2019-09-26T18:00:05Z,"Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to fundamental changes in the way we live. Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?

This documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI’s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI’s social implications?

The Revolution Of AI (2020)
Writers: Kyle McCabe, Christopher Webb Young
Stars: Shivani Bigler, Jason Derenick, Barbara Grosz
Genre: Documentary
Country: United States
Language: English
Also Known As: Hyper Intelligence
Release Date: 2020 (United States)

Synopsis:
Everyone has heard about Artificial Intelligence (or AI), but very few people know what it is or how it actually works. This episode brings this otherwise abstract topic to life by visiting the most cutting-edge engineering firms where innovative technologists are using AI to transform machines into thinking robots.

Leading institutions are preparing robot rovers and flying drones to navigate through unmapped territories, in order to save lives in bold Search and Rescue missions. By ‘mapping as they go’, these thinking machines generate their own intelligence—allowing them to self-navigate without human input. Additionally, some technologists are coordinating swarms of drones to operate and collaborate together—all with the explicit ambition of improving the efficiency of farming and increasing food production.

Though the news media often reports on how machines could cause unemployment, that’s not what AI inventors in this program are saying. In fact, their AI-driven robots are using machine-learning to work better with humans. Through observation, AI robots are learning to anticipate the actions of human co-workers, keeping people safer in the workplace – and making it more productive.

Some scientists in this show are even developing AI robots that are achieving the beginnings of robotic consciousness. By comprehending their own self-image, they are able to learn about their environment, make decisions, and navigate the space around them – just as  human babies do. Other engineers are taking this technology even further to develop real-world Androids – that is, robots that look, feel, and act like people.

Becoming consultants, advisors, and even friends, these Androids will ultimately help individuals adjust to realities of the human condition.

Artificial Intelligence Out of Control: The Apocalypse is Here | How AI and ChatGPT End Humanity

The story of humans began a long time ago.

Three and a half billion years ago protein molecules floated around the ooze called the primordial soup. Then something happened and a molecule made a copy of itself.

And then another copy and another. Soon these molecules arranged themselves into something called a cell.

Then cells clumped together and multiplied. Organisms were created. Over the next three billion years, the organisms became more complicated and more diverse.

375 million years ago one of those organisms crawled out of the sea.

4 million years ago hominids emerged. Hominids had large brains and advanced cognitive abilities. They could reason, communicate and cooperate.

200,000 years ago, homo sapiens, modern humans appeared. They developed agriculture, organized into civilizations and became masters of the planet.

The story of humans began a long time ago. But all stories end.

And according to many leaders in business, science and technology: we're in the final chapter. The part of our story where we finally go extinct.

And there's nothing we can do to stop it.

Elon Musk has done it again—pushing the limits of technology in a way that feels like science fiction. But this time, it’s not about rockets or self-driving cars. It’s something even more groundbreaking—something that could transform how we think, reshape the way we work, and even make us question reality itself. 
A new kind of artificial intelligence has arrived, one so advanced that it’s already outperforming the competition, setting new records, and leaving tech giants scrambling to catch up. Some say it’s the smartest AI on Earth. Others say it’s just the beginning of something much bigger. But one thing is clear—Musk just unleashed a machine so powerful, it could rewrite the future.

Mr Hinton, who has been criticised by some in the world of artificial intelligence for having a pessimistic view of the future of AI, also said that no one knew how to put in effective safeguards and regulation.

43ivaC5SuKE,Mo Gawdat: AI Knows What’s Wrong With Humanity,Mo Gawdat,UCilMYYyoot7vhLn4Tinzmmg,2025-03-08T20:30:00Z,"AI is evolving faster than we ever imagined. While some see it as a threat, I see an opportunity. In this conversation, I explore how AI can create a world of abundance, but also why it is our responsibility to guide its development for the benefit of all.

- Can AI solve humanity’s biggest challenges?
- Why do ethics and human values play a crucial role in shaping AI?
- Will we find happiness in a world where machines take over many tasks?

We are already witnessing how AI is reshaping our world—but the key question is how we will use it. This is not just a technological revolution; it’s a test of our humanity. Watch the video and share your thoughts in the comments!

MG9oqntiJKg,AI Won’t Plateau — if We Give It Time To Think | Noam Brown | TED,TED,UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug,2025-02-15T12:00:33Z,"To get smarter, traditional AI models rely on exponential increases in the scale of data and computing power. Noam Brown, a leading research scientist at OpenAI, presents a potentially transformative shift in this paradigm. He reveals his work on OpenAI's new o1 model, which focuses on slower, more deliberate reasoning — much like how humans think  — in order to solve complex problems.

Geoffrey Hinton, former Vice President of Google and sometimes referred to as the ‘Godfather of AI’, has recently won the 2024 Nobel Physics Prize. He resigned from Google in 2023, and has warned about the dangers of machines that could outsmart humans.

In May 2024, Faisal Islam spoke to the professor for Newsnight.

Artificial intelligence allows machines to do things similar to what humans do, such as having a conversation, solving problems, or even drawing! AI is not only in robots, but also in the voice assistants that help us look things up on the Internet. They use artificial intelligence to be able to answer our questions. If used correctly, artificial intelligence can be a tool that can help us a lot in our daily lives.

This video is a very useful and interesting resource for children. It is perfect for teaching children what artificial intelligence is. It is an excellent video for primary education.

Glenn asked Grok to describe how fast it's improving in human terms: for every 12 hours that pass for Glenn, how much time passes for Grok? Its answer is shocking! Glenn also asks how fast Grok would grow if it was hooked up to a quantum computer chip, like the one Microsoft recently announced. But even more shocking was its answer about the future: what will 2030 look like? What happens after AI reaches artificial super intelligence? Will the ethics constraints built into it be enough to keep it under human control?

Today, artificial intelligence helps doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, and city planners predict traffic. These AIs are often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? Briana Brownell digs into the three basic ways machines investigate, negotiate, and communicate.

In the last few years data science has become an increasingly popular discipline. Often linked to the use and analysis of ‘big data’, data scientists are seen as the new professionals who can unlock the potential of an increasingly data-rich world, and to generate economic and social benefits from the data revolution.

However within the world of statistics, the ‘big data’ and ‘data scientist’ developments are sometimes labelled as hypes, and ‘data science’ is seen as a rebranding of what should be statistics. One of the often heard criticisms of big data analytics is that there’s a lack of statistical rigour which can lead to the wrong decisions.

As with any new discipline there are questions about exactly what data science is. Has the relevance of statistics been diminished because of new types of data or technologies which need a radical new approach? Is data science about ‘getting the job done’, and statistics about the deeper scientific understanding? Are our universities offering students the right skill sets to meet the high demand for data scientists?",68689,906,47,0.0139,1:35:38,29,"RSS, statistics, data science, Chris Wiggins, David Hand, Francine Bennett, Patrick Wolfe, Zoubin Ghahramani, Martin Goodson, John Pullinger, stats, Data Science and Statistics: different worlds",10500,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83oOOF9lg-g1XMT_UK1tUw

One of the most critical aspects of the data science approach is our perception of getting the information processed. In developing insights from our accumulated data, we dig out the possibilities. And those possibilities are known as statistical analysis in Data science.
Statistics acts as a tool to gather, extract, analyze, and review data, which is an input to Data science techniques; hence, learning statistics is a baby step toward becoming a data scientist. Great Learning‘s Statistics for Data Science course is for beginners and professionals who want to upgrade their skills in data science domains and learn everything about statistical analysis.

In this video we discuss how to transition into data science. Today, we’ll be making the switch from economics and examine the good, the bad and the ugly. We’ll answer some of the most important questions running through your mind, like: “Can I”, “Should I” and “How can I” transition into data science from economics. And we’ll discuss the pros and cons before finding the best way to transition into Data Science.

Let’s start with “Can I make the transition into data science?”. The answer here is a resounding “yes!”. Roughly 13% of current data scientists have an Economics degree. For comparison, the most well-represented discipline is data science and analysis, which takes up 21% of the pie. Therefore, Economics is a competitive discipline when it comes to data science. 

First, unlike STEM disciplines, social studies help develop great presentational skills which are essential for any data scientist. Through presentations and open discussions, students learn how to present a topic, as well as argue for or against a given statement. These activities result in developing a confident and credible way of showcasing actionable insights. Moreover, most econ majors deeply care about human behavior and response to different stimuli.

Furthermore, Economics frequently intertwines with Mathematics, Finance, Psychology, and Politics. Therefore, an economist’s approach is always meant to be interdisciplinary. 

Finally, the technical capabilities of an economist are often quite impressive. An average economist has a good understanding of Machine Learning without really referring to it as such. Linear regressions and logistic regressions are studied in almost all Economics degrees.

Many videos provide tips on becoming a data scientist—learning the necessary skills and the expected salaries in the field. But there isn’t nearly as much content that describes what data scientists do on the job. Today, we’ll address this topic.  
Contrary to what many business stakeholders believe, a data scientist isn’t a magician who can use AI to fix any problem.  
A data scientist’s primary purpose isn’t to pull data from the database either . 
A company that thrives—thanks to its data scientists—can educate those  within the organization that a data scientist’s primary goal is to create business value by using data . A data scientist’s role encompasses different activities, many of which we will describe in this video. Still, the first and most crucial point we need to remember is that the end goal of each task of a data scientist is to create business value. 
Therefore—besides solid statistics knowledge and an ability to use such coding languages as Python, R, and SQL—data scientists need business and communication skills to be successful in their work .

This animation, from the SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science, explains that data science really is EVERYWHERE! 

SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science (SIMODS) publishes work that advances mathematical, statistical, and computational methods in the context of data and information sciences. We invite papers that present significant advances in this context, including applications to science, engineering, business, and medicine.

FULL MANUSCRIPT:
Right now, you’re a few clicks away from streaming a 4K video tour of a far-away city, and exploring a 3D map of it in virtual reality. If you want to actually visit the city, your phone can arrange for a car — maybe even a self-driving car — to pick you up just as you land. While it’s shuttling you around, apps can suggest hotels and sites to visit.

We are living in the age of data science.

Data science is everywhere, but how does it actually work? When the data analysts, scientists, and engineers who build these applications run up against the limits of what’s currently possible, how do they make the next breakthrough?    

The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics has a new journal for mathematicians, computer scientists, geneticists, neuroscientists, economists and anyone who works with big data: the SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science, known as SIMODS.

Through SIMODS, researchers are popping the the hood and tinkering with the engine that makes these applications work, and work better: applied mathematics, and the related domains of computer science, statistics, signal processing, and network science.

The compression techniques that allow you to stream a 4K movie are in a constant race with growing file sizes. In the future, techniques like matrix sketching can be used to efficiently discover  the underlying low-dimensional manifold and achieve even greater compression rates. This will make your movies stream faster and with better image quality.

Deep learning techniques use stochastic optimization for quick and accurate translations. Even more powerful techniques will be necessary to handle the technical language found in specialized categories of speech, like those in law, medicine, and science.

What about unsupervised learning, where there are no categories at all? 

Would you trust your computer to organize the photos from your trip, with no instructions on what folders to make? What about images of brain scans, and your computer could find never-before-seen patterns and correlations that human neuroscientists would never think to look for? Applied math techniques like clustering can make these organizational tasks even better, allowing for applications that seem like science fiction today.    

Looking forward, imagine machine learning methods that can keep your data completely private, explain their decisions while offering customized suggestions, and be robust to new situations. Can data science move us forward in terms of fairness and diversity? What about using algorithms to achieve long-term goals?

Computer scientists and engineers are inventing the future every day, and applied mathematics gives them the tools they need to keep moving forward. SIMODS is looking for interdisciplinary work that pushes the boundaries of data science and takes the field in new directions.",13304,145,3,0.0111,0:03:23,28,"data science, what is data science, should i study data science, data analysis, AI, machine learning, self driving car, programming, stochastic optimization, statistical inference, network science, computer science, applied math, how much math should a data analyst know, what can you do with data, how does uber work, how does siri work, big data, how is big data applied, math for data scientists, how much data is there, data minig",13800,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzgfBbH5wlakWp3GhLthPUQ

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what Machine Learning is, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.

The below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

If you are curious and want to get an overview of how ML and DL is applied to NLP systems, this video is for you!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the second part of the first lecture of the NLP learn from scratch series! In this video, I dive deep into the evolution of NLP approaches; From classical machine learning models to cutting‐edge deep learning techniques. Whether you are new to NLP or looking to solidify your fundamentals, this video is packed with insights that will guide you through:

• Core NLP Terminologies & Concepts: Learn how we represent text as numerical vectors, understand classification techniques, and why these representations are essential for computer processing.

• Statistical & Machine Learning Models: I walk you through models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields—explaining their strengths, weaknesses, and where they fit in real-world applications.

• Deep Learning for NLP: Get an overview of sequential models (RNNs, LSTMs) versus non-sequential models (CNNs) and see how transformers revolutionized language processing with their self-attention mechanism.

• Challenges & the Future: I discuss why deep learning is not yet the silver bullet for all NLP tasks—covering cost, on-device deployment, and the ongoing struggle with interpretability—and how recent advances are beginning to tackle these issues.

• Certification & Career Path: Plus, I share insights on the NVIDA certification exam syllabus, recommended prerequisites, and the job roles you can aim for once you master these technologies.

I believe that building a strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning fundamentals is key before diving into advanced NLP techniques. So, if you are serious about becoming a proficient NLP engineer or a LLM engineer and acing your certification exams, make sure you watch the entire series from the beginning.

Stay tuned, stay curious, and let’s explore the fascinating world of NLP together! Don’t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell icon for updates on upcoming lectures.

From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever.

FZmR_m0KuC8,Day 6 : 🤖 Machine Learning vs Deep Learning: What&#39;s the Difference? 🧠 #shorts #EMC #tech,Error Makes Clever,UCwr-evhuzGZgDFrq_1pLt_A,2023-11-20T12:30:12Z,"Day 6 : Welcome to Day 6 of our 30 Days 30 Terms Series! Today, we're breaking down the differences between Machine Learning and Deep Learning! 🚀

Machine Learning is like teaching a child what to do and how to do it. The machine performs tasks based on the instructions you provide, similar to how a child follows guidance from a teacher.

On the other hand, Deep Learning is an advanced concept within machine learning. Imagine the child growing up and making decisions based on past experiences and data they've collected over time. Deep learning models work similarly, utilizing networks that mimic the human brain's structure to make more complex and informed decisions.

Imagine you have a toy robot that learns from pictures of cats and dogs. Every time you show the robot a picture and tell it what animal it is, the robot starts to remember and gets better at recognizing them on its own. This process is similar to how machine learning works!

Machine learning involves teaching computers to learn from data, allowing them to make predictions and decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. By feeding the computer lots of examples, it can recognize patterns and improve over time. This technology is behind many of the smart applications we use today, from voice assistants to recommendation systems.

Join us as we break down the basics of machine learning, discuss its importance, and show you how it shapes the technology we use every day. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to refresh your understanding, this video will give you a clear and concise overview of machine learning.

Y5x8xvDnLXk,Janani K. Jha  - Machine Learning (Official Lyric Video),Janani K. Jha,UCor_kFLwhSPubDOkuFFWNXA,2022-11-04T04:00:08Z,"""Machine Learning” is a song about social performance, about what happens when you construct so many different versions of yourself to please others that you lose sight of the ""real"" you. As someone who's struggled their entire life with social anxiety, I find I sometimes feel like a robot, constantly programming my behavior to maximize my social output and make other people happy -- even at the expense of my own feelings. Growing up being dubbed the ""weird"" kid left me with a deep fear of exclusion; ""Machine Learning"" is my attempt to chronicle what it was like to bury that ""weirdness"" for years before I grew the confidence to show my authentic self to the world.

It truly means the world to me that I get to be so vulnerable in my music with you. Thank you for everything. I hope you enjoy this ro-bop. :)

It is designed and taught by Aakash N S, CEO and co-founder of Jovian. Check out their YouTube channel here: https://youtube.com/@jovianhq

We'll start with the basics of machine learning by exploring models like linear & logistic regression and then move on to tree-based models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosting machines. We'll also discuss best practices for approaching and managing machine learning projects and build a state-of-the-art machine learning model for a real-world dataset from scratch. We'll also look at unsupervised learning & recommendations briefly and walk through the process of deploying a machine-learning model to the cloud using the Flask web framework.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to confidently build, train, and deploy machine learning models in the real world. To get the most out of this course, follow along & type out all the code yourself, and apply the techniques covered here to other real-world datasets & competitions that you can find on platforms like Kaggle.

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation to Nielsen if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

sqs8DxGhwM8,COMMENT FONCTIONNE LE MACHINE LEARNING ?,Machine Learnia,UCmpptkXu8iIFe6kfDK5o7VQ,2019-04-16T06:04:01Z,"Le Machine Learning est tout autour de vous. Les algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique et les réseaux de neurones font tourner YouTube, Google, Amazon, Facebook… la reconnaissance vocale, la voiture autonome, les hôpitaux, le système judiciaire. Le monde entier se tourne vers cette technologie. Mais pourquoi donc ?
Et bien il faut savoir qu’à l’origine, les ordinateurs ne sont pas intelligents. Ils sont juste doués pour faire des calculs. Mais tous les problèmes ne peuvent pas être résolu par des calculs : par exemple reconnaitre un chat depuis le signal électrique que notre œil nous envoie.
Mais le Machine Learning (apprentissage automatique) donne la capacité aux ordinateurs de dépasser cette limite en leur fournissant la capacité d’apprendre à faire une tâche à partir de données.
Pour cela, il existe ce qu’on appelle des algorithmes d’apprentissage, et il en existe 3 grandes familles :
- Le Supervised Learning (apprentissage supervisé) qui consiste à fournir à la machine des données étiquetées X, Y (labelled dataset) et la machine apprend alors le lien qui uni X et Y.
- Le Unsupervised Learning (apprentissage non supervisé) qui consiste à laisser la machine apprendre des structures dans les données X sans lui montrer Y
- Le Reinforcement Learning (Apprentissage par renforcement) qui consiste à récompenser la machine lorsqu’elle entreprend des bonnes actions pour qu’elle apprenne comment agir en autonomie.
Le Deep Learning (apprentissage profond) est une technique au sein même du machine Learning qui vise à développer des réseaux de neurones extrêmement larges pour en utilisant des milliards de données dans le but de dépasser les compétences humaines.

In this video we learn how three phase electricity works from the basics. The basics of Three phase electricity explained. We start with a simple single phase AC generator and then add in a second and third phase to under stand its working principle. We also cover three phase power uses and distribution as well as why we don't use more phases.

#U2 #ElectricalStorm #Remastered

Lyrics:

The sea it swells like a sore head and the night it is aching
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed
And the day it is breaking

On rainy days we'd go swimming out
On rainy days swimming in the sound
On rainy days we'd go swimming out

You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
If the sky can crack there must be someway back
For love and only love

Electrical Storm
Electrical Storm
Baby don't cry

Car alarm won't let you back to sleep
You're kept awake dreaming someone elses dream
Coffee is cold but it'll get you through
Compromise that's nothing new to you.
Let's see colours that have never been seen
Let's go places no one else has been

You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
Well if the sky can crack there must be someway back
To love and only love

Electrical storm x 3
Baby don't cry

It's hot as hell, honey in this room
Sure hope the weather will break soon
The air is heavy, heavy as a truck
We need the rain to wash away our bad luck

Well if the sky can crack there must be some way back
To love and only love

Electrical storm x 3

Backup Generator Recommendations
✅  4500 Running Watts - https://amzn.to/3LNSiq7
(This is on the smaller side but its a good quality generator and will work for you if you are selective with your loads)
✅  8000 Running Watts - https://amzn.to/3A8uACs
(This is the option I would choose. It has the size to run your loads without having to worry about staging them on. It can also handle most AC units with a soft start. I will be buying this one to replace what I have now)
✅  9500 Running Watts - https://amzn.to/3SvhGok
(I would buy this generator if I was planning on installing a 50A inlet box. This generator will back up your whole home. A 50A installation is the same process but with a larger wire, a 50A inlet and a 2-pole 50A breaker.)
✅  30A Generator Connection Cord (25 feet). https://amzn.to/3WM5z91

Annie Leonard takes viewers from the mines and factories where our gadgets begin to the horrific backyard recycling shops in China where many end up. The film concludes with a call for a green 'race to the top' where designers compete to make long-lasting, toxic-free products that are fully and easily recyclable.

Our production partner on the electronics film is the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, which promotes green design and responsible recycling in the electronics industry.

And I don't normally post about the books I buy, but THIS book is amazing. Anyone who likes electronics, computers, or engineering should consider picking up a copy.

Seeing inside each component gives me a new understanding when I'm breadboarding or prototyping a circuit design—and why some components tend to fail more easily than others!

You can pre-order it on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3fHTtKT (I bought mine directly from No Starch Press months ago, and they just started shipping it out to the early buyers this week)

It also serves as a basis for further study of individual components such as DRAM or GPUs.  The video introduces the architecture of a modern personal computer. The main components on a PC motherboard are identified including the central processing unit, the graphics adaptor, the Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and the so called chip set.   The various busses connecting these components are also mentioned including the memory bus, PCI Express, and Direct Media Interface.  The structure of a typical multi-core CPU is described including the built in memory controller, built in graphics controller and the CPU cache.  The structure and operation of the CPU cache is illustrated; specifically the way in which the cache is organised in levels and the way that data and instructions move around in 64 byte blocks known as cache lines. The utility CPU-Z is then used to examine some of the components of real PC.",89317,1886,70,0.0219,0:18:06,27,"computer science, computing, CPU, processor, core, multi-core, arithmetic and logic unit, ALU, control unit, memory bus, DMI, PCI Express, chipset, chip set, front side bus, FSB, DRAM, graphics controller, memory controller, dynamic random access memory, SRAM, static random access memory, DDR4, cache, L1 cache, L2 cache, L3 cache, cache line, CPU-Z, oscillator, clock speed, overclocking, overclock, multiplier, architecture, hardware, motherboard, RAM, frequency, base clock",229000,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSX3MR0gnKDxyXAyljWzm0Q

Today we’re going to create memory! Using the basic logic gates we discussed in episode 3 we can build a circuit that stores a single bit of information, and then through some clever scaling (and of course many new levels of abstraction) we’ll show you how we can construct the modern random-access memory, or RAM, found in our computers today. RAM is the working memory of a computer. It holds the information that is being executed by the computer and as such is a crucial component for a computer to operate. Next week we’ll use this RAM, and the ALU we made last episode, to help us construct our CPU - the heart of a computer. 

*CORRECTION*

In our 16x16 Latch Matrix graphic, we inadvertently left off the horizontal row access line above the top row of latches.  As a result, the highlighted line for the row at address 12 should actually be one line higher.

Have you ever wondered how electronic devices work? From sand to sophisticated technology, we've created a video that will take you through the entire process, step by step.  This short is just one snippet, so check out the full video at the link above!  You will discover how silicon dioxide or quartz from sand is transformed into semiconductor material and how it's controlled to conduct electricity. You'll also learn how transistors are made, which act as switches or amplifiers. You'll then explore how billions of these transistors are used in modern CPUs, making them switch on and off faster, allowing you to do more things in the same amount of space and power. Finally, you'll be introduced to digital logic and how switches are used to create digital devices that think in 1s and 0s.

Have you ever wondered why it takes time for computers to load programs or video games?  Also, ever wonder why your computer uses both DRAM as well as SSDs when they both are used to store data?  
Well, most of that time is spent moving data from a hard drive or SSD into DRAM or Dynamic Random Access Memory, which is the working memory inside your computer.  In this video, we're going to take a very deep dive into DRAM.  We'll see how it connects to other parts of your computer, and then we'll explore how DRAM can store gigabytes of data in nanoscopic capacitors.  After that, we'll cover the three main operations of DRAM: Reading, Writing, and Refreshing.  And finally, we'll dive deep into some more complex aspects of DRAM that make it so amazingly fast such as folded DRAM architecture.  We'll also learn what burst buffers are, and why there are so many banks of DRAM memory cells.

In this video we will learn about the ""Von-Neumann Architecture"".

In this world every things and object has its architecture, like human body architecture, car model architecture and office building has its own architecture.Architecture defines how the object models and works.

The same way computer also has its own architecture on which its run.

There are two types of architecture :-
1) Von-Neumann Architecture
2) Harvard Architecture

Von Neumann Architecture was designed by the great mathematician and scientist John Von Neumann in 1945.
Most of the computer of the world runs on this architecture.

Von Neumann Architecture has four components :-

1) Input
2) Memory
3) Process
4) Output

David Patterson is a Turing award winner and professor of computer science at Berkeley. He is known for pioneering contributions to RISC processor architecture used by 99% of new chips today and for co-creating RAID storage. The impact that these two lines of research and development have had on our world is immeasurable. He is also one of the great educators of computer science in the world. His book with John Hennessy ""Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"" is how I first learned about and was humbled by the inner workings of machines at the lowest level.

In this video you will get to know about Von Neumann's Architecture. It is called Stored Memory Program or Stored Memory Architecture. Here, we have two elements in the memory i.e. one is Data and other is Program(Set of Instructions).
This is the earliest architecture also known as stored memory architecture. Students find this topic complex but after watching this video you will understand all the concepts clearly. These concepts are important for competitive exams like GATE, UGC NET, NIELIT, PSUs, DSSSB etc. and college/university exams also.

Computer Architecture is a functional behavior of computer system.

Architecture describes what the computer does.

For designing a computer, its architecture is fixed first.

Computer Architecture comprises logical functions such as instruction sets, registers, data types and addressing modes.
Computer Organization deals with structural relationship.

Organization describes how it does it.


For designing a computer, organization is decided after its architecture.

Computer Organization consists of physical units like circuit designs, peripherals and addresses.

For more information on Engineering & Technology courses offered by ECU: https://www.ecu.edu.au/degrees/study-areas/engineering-and-technology?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=ecu-adhoc-youtube&utm_content=electronics-communications-engineering-kG2HWJZjdAQ

Jordan talks about his experiences how the practical hands-on laboratories helped him better understand the theory covered in units. He discusses experiences in robotics, programming real robots in laboratories. He's recently completed a digital unit, where he programmed a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and learn about logic gates and timing. He finds the lecturers to be very down-to-earth and approachable. 

Jordan talks about entering the course as a mature-age student (non school leaver). He completed the prerequisites to get himself up to speed and ensure his understanding was what was required.

He discusses the structure of the course. In the first year, you get a broad sense of all engineering fields. As a result he's completed several mechanical engineering units and structural engineering units. In the second year onwards, the course is very practical with opportunities to apply the things you've learnt. He says the units are now focusing in on the specific field he's studying, so he's doing a lot more of the electrical and communications side of engineering.

He talks about the work placements opportunities within the course and the placement in the final year. He also talks about accessing the units online, if you can't get to lectures or you want to review.

Jordan discusses how his creative passion (he's a guitarist as well) is also adding to his course. He wants to build his own amplifier and equipment when he completes the course and he says the units are helping him realise that aim.",101703,1193,0,0.0117,0:03:04,27,"australia, communication engineer, computer and communication engineering, e and tc engineering, e&tc engineering, ec engineering, ece, ecu, ecu communication, edith cowan university, electrical communication engineering, electrical engineer, electronic communication engineering, electronic engineer, electronics and communications engineering, engineer, engineering, information and communication engineering, perth, telecommunication engineering, university, western australia",76400,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSG50nxOENF5c5-KsAf53sw

In this video, the block diagram of the communication system, as well as some of the terminologies often used in communication engineering, is discussed. 

What is Communication?

Communication is the exchange of information between the two or more points.
Electronics point of view, it is the exchange of information using the electronic device or gadget between two or more points which can be far away from each other.

The Basic Block diagram of the Communication System:

The communication system contains the following basic blocks:

1) The Source
2) Input Transducer
3) Transmitter
4) Channel 
5) Receiver
6) Output Transducer

Source:
The source is the origin from where the message signal is generated.
The message could be voice signal, email, Television Signal, or data.

Input Transducer:
Using the input transducer, the message signal is converted into the electrical signal.

Transmitter:
The transmitter signal modifies the input signal for efficient transmission.
The transmitter may contain several sub-systems like modulator, analog to digital converter, encoder, amplifier etc.

Channel:
The channel is the medium over which the transmitted signal is transmitted.
The channel could be physical channel (e.g optical fiber, co-axial cable) or wireless channel (radio link)
The channel partly behaves like a filter and, attenuates and distorts the transmitted signal.

The receiver:
For faithful communication, the receiver should be able to recover the message signal from the received (distorted and attenuated) signal.
The receiver also contains several subsystems like, demodulator, decoder, digital to analog converter, amplifier.

Output Transducer:
The output of the receiver is given to the output transducer. Speaker, monitor screen are examples of the output transducer.

Communication Techniques aren't something that is taught at university, you learn to write technical reports and may be present to engineers, however, in the workforce you need to communicate to a broad range of audiences with varied skill sets. as an engineer, your communication skills need to be able to break down technical knowledge to someone that has no engineering ability. 
Communication is what we really produce, whether that be in meetings, in the drawings we produce or the reports we write, if you cannot communicate your engineering ability is pointless.

Also, communication is just about output, to effectively communicate you also need to be able to listen and understand the issues. As communication is a two what street, and if you are able to understand the issues you can more effectively pass your knowledge on, and make the projects better.

1. Embedded Systems Design
Embedded system is a combination of hardware and software.   An embedded system course is a very good choice as it is a good job the area which merges the electrical engineering and computer science. Embedded course presently having a very high scope as embedded industry especially in it and raspberry pi is growing very fast. 

2. CCNA/CCNP
It is one of those courses which are chosen by students. It is a CISCO certified networking administrator course. The next level up gradation is CCNP. This course costs relevantly lower than other courses but the certification is mandatory for some companies.It is one of those courses which are chosen by students. 

3. Embedded Hardware
As we know the embedded system is a combination of hardware and software, it includes both hardware and software. Hardware part includes the designing of PCB, circuit design and hardware testing and troubleshooting. Embedded hardware domain also so many jobs are available.

4. PLC and SCADA
 This course focuses mainly on the field of automation engineering. You can work in this field for development/maintenance or in industries. This field won’t restrict you to the electronics field only. In automation, you can also have a chance of working in mechanical industries also.

5. VLSI
VLSI includes a great technology adds with the data which includes the deep understanding and good development of integrated circuits and it loads the data. And the least talked or joined course was is the VLSI course. As because this is the most costly among the core ECE courses but the future of VLSI is emerging and not a dead-end profile to have right now i.e spending that much of money is worth if you want to work in this field.
